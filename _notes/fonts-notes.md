# My Preference for Larger Traditional X Bitmap Monospaced Fonts in Terminals 

My current (as of Jun 15, 2025) traditional X11 bitmap monospaced font is **Gallant**. 

* Traditional X bitmap font: Gallant is likely designed in the X11 bitmap font format, which is a common format for bitmap fonts used in X Window System environment.
These fonts are typically fixed in size and are represented as pixel images for each character.
* Monospaced: As a monospaced font, Gallant ensures that each character occupies the same amount of horizontal space.
This uniformity is essential for programming, text editing, and terminal applications, where alignment of text is important.

## How To Use Gallant Font with Xterm

For example, to use the Gallant font with xterm and with a font size of 14 points, run this command:

```
% xterm -fa gallant -fs 14
```

> There are two major type systems in X: [Core and Xft](http://www.xfree86.org/current/fonts2.html).
> Core fonts are *bitmaps* and are recommended in a terminal.
> They come in the form of *BDFs* (and are *compressed* as *PCFs*).
> 
> *Xft* fonts are *antialiased* and you don't want these *unless* you're looking at *larger fonts*.
> You'll recognize them as *TTFs*.
> Actually, you can selectively turn off antialiasing of TTFs, but still doesn't solve the lack of bold/italic offerings.

# My Preference for Larger Xft (TrueType) Monospaced Fonts in Terminals 

## Getting a List of Fonts to Try

If you have fontconfig, here's how to determine which monospaced scalable fonts you have installed, ie those that are suitable for terminal use:

```
% fc-list :spacing=mono:scalable=true family | sort
```

## Monospaced Sans fonts vs. Monospaced Serif fonts

For terminal use, some people prefer monospaced sans fonts over monospaced serif fonts because for them serifs interfere with readability.

# Fonts

From [Guide to X11/Fonts](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_X11/Fonts#Core_versus_Xft_fonts) (Retrieved on Jun 15, 2025):

When your X11 clients draw text, they use *fonts*, which are drawings of standard characters, such as letters, numerals, and punctuation.
At minimum, a font is a *typeface* (also called *family*) such as *Bitstream Vera Sans, Luxi Mono, Nimbus Roman No9 L, or fixed*.
More specifically, a font includes a size or style, such as **Bitstream Vera Sans Bold Italic 10 point**.

Fonts also come in three categories called *serif* (like Nimbus Roman No9 L), *sans-serif* (like Bitstream Vera Sans), and *monospace* (like Luxi Mono or "fixed").

Fonts come in several font formats such as bitmap, TrueType, and PostScript.

TrueType fonts are *.ttf* files.
If the X11 server and client are at different computers, then you might have installed different fonts at each computer. 


# Core versus Xft fonts

X11 clients can draw texts in several different manners:

1. Use the *original core X11 protocol* to draw text.
With this approach, the X11 server loads and stores each character of a font. Thus, if the X11 server (with the screen and keyboard) and the X11 client (with your web browser or other window) are at different computers, then you must install fonts at the server. The server converts the characters into *bitmaps* and draws them *upright*, which means that you *cannot rotate them*.
Further, the server *never antialiases* the fonts.
2. Use the ***Xft** library* and *RENDER extension to draw text*.
With this approach, the X11 client loads and stores each character of a font.
You must install fonts at the client machine.
The client converts the characters into geometric shapes.
It decomposes the shapes into basic shapes such as triangles and trapezoids, then sends these to the server.
The server draws the shapes and *optionally provides antialiasing*, which *smooths the appearance of fonts*.
One *can also rotate these shapes*.
3. Use a *client-side library* such as *libart_lgpl or SDL_ttf to draw text*.
While libart_lgpl is a vector-graphics library, SDL_ttf is a library to draw text for programs that use the cross-platform Simple DirectMedia Layer. Typically, these libraries load the geometric shapes, then draw them into bitmaps, possibly antialiased and rotated, before sending them to the X11 server, as if the X11 server knew nothing about text. It is also possible for these libraries to do as Xft does and use RENDER.

The first X11 clients used the core X11 protocol to draw text, as that was the only choice.
However, several clients now use Xft.
Because *GTK+* and *Qt*, the *toolkits behind several applications including all GNOME and KDE applications*, switched to *Xft*, many programs on most desktops, including Konqueror, now use Xft.

* Installing fonts in Xft 
* Fine-tuning Xft  
* Configuring applications
* Troubleshooting 

### Configuring the core X11 fonts system

### Adding a font to your system

From [Adding a font to your system](http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/GECG/X_Font_ProcAddFn.html) (Retrieved on Jun 15, 2025):

* Place the new font file or files in the directory in which you want to store them.
* (Optional) Run the bdftopcf utility, if desired, to convert BDF font files to PCF files:

```
bdftopcf font.bdf > font.pcf
```

* Run the mkfontdir command and indicate the font's directory location, if necessary:

```
mkfontdir font_location
```

* If you added fonts to a directory not in the current font path, add the new directory to the font search path:

```
xset fp+ font_location
```

* Reset the server's font database with the following command:

```
xset fp rehash
```

## Installing Orp-Font fonts from source

[https://github.com/MicahElliott/Orp-Font?tab=readme-ov-file#from-source](https://github.com/MicahElliott/Orp-Font?tab=readme-ov-file#from-source)

> If you just want to start using the provided Orp fonts without tweaking glyphs or moving things around, all you need to do is run:

```
% cd orp-font
% xset +fp $PWD/misc
```

> You should now be able to fire up an xterm (or better: urxvt) and see the new Orp you just "installed":

```
% xterm -fn '-misc-orp-medium-r-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1'
```

> Put the ``xset`` line (hard-code expanded ``$PWD``) into your ``~/.Xdefaults`` and you're now permanent!
>
> [ . . . ]
>
> I've taken my very favorite existing monospace font, [Pro Font](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_font), adapted an xterm friendly BDF for it, and enhanced some of its glyphs to be slightly more friendly.
> Plus, Iâ€™ve added a few other derivative fonts that make up the Orp family.
>
> [ . . . ]
>
> All you need to understand
>
> A *BDF file* is the 'source code' of your font.
> It is modifiable via a tool called ``gbdfed`` (Gtk BDF EDitor), which is pretty easy for any n00b to start whacking glyphs with.
 After you're happy with your BDF you run it through a bunch of tools that create an output *(gzipped) PCF file*.
> Finally you tell X to start using the font/directory.
> 
> There are two major type systems in X: [Core and Xft](https://www.xfree86.org/current/fonts2.html)
> Core fonts are "bitmaps" and are *what you want in a terminal*.
> They come in the form of *BDFs* (and are *compressed* as *PCFs*).
> Xft fonts are antialiased and you don't want these [in a terminal] *unless* you're looking at *larger fonts*.
> You'll recognize them as *TTFs*.
> Actually, you can selectively turn off antialiasing of TTFs, but still doesn't solve the lack of bold/italic offerings.
>
> [ . . . ]
>
>
> Figure out what your new font is actually called.

```
% xfontsel
```

> Make sure your new font shows up under 'fmly' and select it.
You can paste that crazy -*-my font-*-... string into your ``~/.Xdefaults-$(hostname)`` file.
> My preference:

```
*font:       -misc-orp-medium-r-*-*-12-*-75-75-*-60-iso10646-*
*boldFont:   -misc-orp-bold-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
*italicFont: -misc-orp-*-i-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1
```

> You can see it and other fonts on the system with ``xlsfonts`` (and maybe ``fc-list``).
