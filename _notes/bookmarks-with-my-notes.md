## Backup

* [Performing backups the right way](https://whynothugo.nl/journal/2014/08/06/performing-backups-the-right-way/)

* [Rsync Backups and Snapshoting - Anthony Thyssen](https://antofthy.gitlab.io/info/usage/rsync_backup.txt)
> Rsync Backups and Snapshoting
>
> Making incremental backups (snapshots) with rsync
> 
> It's actually very easy to use rsync to create multiple snapshot of a backup.
>
> All you have to do is create a hard linked copy of the backup tree before
(or after) you run rsync.
> Each snapshot will have a hardlinked copy of the files, so each snapshot uses very little extra disk space.
> 
 Then when a file changes, rsync will unlink and recreate that files, while
leaving the old version of the changed file older hardlinked snapshots
untouched.
> 
> This means you can have many 'snapshots' of your backup (hours, days, etc) each with a copy of the files as they existed at the time the snapshot was made, with only the changed files using extra disk space.
> A very efficent of disk space for a snapshot system.
>
> However, be warned that file premissions, and ownership is shared via hardlinks, so if later updated changes some files owner or permission than ALL the copies of that linked file will also recieved the same change.
> This is the only cavat with a hardlinked snapshot system.

  - Also: [https://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html](https://www.jwz.org/doc/backups.html)
> Dear Lazyweb, and also a certain you-know-who-you-are who should certainly know better by now, I am here to tell you about backups. It's very simple. 
>
> . . . 
>   
> ```
> $ sudo rsync -vax --delete --ignore-errors / /Volumes/Backup/
> ```
> 
> If your version of rsync supports the `--xattrs` and `--acls` options (it probably does), use those too. 
> 
> If you have a desktop computer, have this happen every morning at 5AM by creating a temporary text file containing this line:
> 
> ```

> You have a computer. It came with a hard drive in it. Go buy two more drives of the same size or larger. If the drive in your computer is SATA2, get SATA2. If it's a 2.5" laptop drive, get two of those. Brand doesn't matter, but physical measurements and connectors should match. -- By: Jamie Zawinski, 2007.

* [crontab_backup_script](https://github.com/jloughry/crontab_backup_script)
> Inspired by [http://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/09/psa-backups/](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/09/psa-backups/) and extended to maintain off-line backups. 
> 
> Inspired by [jwz's](http://www.jwz.org/blog/2007/09/psa-backups/) method for on-line backups and modified in light of the [CryptoLocker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker) malware to use off-line storage, this script runs nightly to synchronise `rsync` backups.
> 
> The method used to mount and unmount off-line storage is Mac OS X-specific, but this script backs up data residing on co-located servers, Windows machines, Macs, and web servers.
> 
> The `line_to_put_in_crontab` should be put in **root**'s crontab.
> 
> The backup volumes are kept unmounted; they really should be kept physically unplugged and powered off in case CryptoLocker gets smart enough in future to try mounting disks before it goes hunting.

### Rsync Snapshots

* [linux-timemachine -- Rsync-based OSX-like time machine for Linux, MacOS and BSD for atomic and resumable local and remote backups](https://github.com/cytopia/linux-timemachine)
> Rsync-based OSX-like time machine for Linux, MacOS and BSD for atomic and resumable local and remote backups.
> 
> timemachine is a tiny and stable KISS (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411220714/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) driven and POSIX (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant script that mimics the behavior of OSX's timemachine. It uses rsync (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to incrementally back up your data to a different directory, hard disk or remote server via SSH. All operations are incremental, atomic and automatically resumable.
> 
> By default it uses the rsync options: --recursive, --perms, --owner, --group, --times and --links. In case your target filesystem does not support any of those options or you cannot use them due to missing permission, you can explicitly disable them via --no-perms, --no-owner, --no-group, --no-times, and --copy-links. See FAQ (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/https://github.com/cytopia/linux-timemachine#bulb-faq) for examples.
> 
> Motivation
> 
> The goal of this project is to have a cross-operating system and minimal as possible backup script that can be easily reviewed by anyone without great effort. Additionally it should provide one task only and do it well without the need of external requirements and only rely on default installed tools.
> 
> Retention
> 
> As described above this project is KISS driven and only tries to do one job: back up your data.
> 
> Retention is a delicate topic as you want to be sure that data is removed as intended. For this there are already well-established tools that do an excellent job and have proven themselves over time: tmpreaper (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/tmpreaper.8.html) and tmpwatch (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/https://linux.die.net/man/8/tmpwatch).
> 
> Reliability
> 
> The script is written and maintained with maximum care. In order to retain a reliable and stable backup solution, a lot of effort goes into a vast amount of integration and regression tests (https://web.archive.org/web/20220411142007/https://github.com/cytopia/linux-timemachine/actions). These tests not only give you measurable confidence, but also help new contributors to not accidentally introduce new or old bugs.
> 
> FAQ
> 
> Q: Should I add trailing directory slashes (/)?
> A: Trailing directory slashes only matter for the source directory and will not make a difference if added to the destination directory.

* [rsync-time-backup -- Time Machine style backup with rsync](https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup)
> This script offers Time Machine-style backup using rsync. It creates incremental backups of files and directories to the destination of your choice. The backups are structured in a way that makes it easy to recover any file at any point in time.

## Documentation

* [Documentation - Oatmeal](https://eli.li/docs)
> Documentation
>
> Here are some scattered thoughts on writing and maintaining documentation. My experience doing this is wholly confined to software development, but I think most of this advice is general enough to make sense in other domains, too.
>
> All text is hypertext.
>
> One thing well
> 
> I think good documentation picks a lane and runs there.
> It doesn't try to be everything for everyone all at once.
> 
> The lanes available:
> * **Tutorials**, learning-oriented (teaching someone to cook)
> * **How-to guides**, problem-oriented (a recipe for cooking a specific thing)
> * **Explanation**, understanding-oriented (historical overview of an ingredientâ€™s cultural importance)
> * **Reference**, information-oriented (an encyclopedia article about an ingredient)
> 
> Each of these maps fairly well to an audience:
> * Tutorials are for folks who *are totally new to a thing*
> * How-to guides are a step up from tutorials and *help you learn idioms and best practices* of a space
> * Explanation is useful when needing to *convey the value of a thing*
> * Reference is generally *for experts who are cozy doing* the thing

> So let me offer a few observations about paper.

> 1. Buy three-hole punched printer paper.
> 2. Write on it.
> 3. Everything goes into a single-three ringed notebook in chronological order, no exceptions.
> 4. When that notebook is full, take the paper out, put a sheet of brown cardstock on each end, and put brass fasteners through the holes.
> 5. That "book" then goes on a bookshelf, never to be looked at again.

* [Note Taking, Writing and Life Organization Using Plain Text Files](http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html)
> The Why: Advantages and Disadvantages of Plaintext Files
> 
> "Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so hard." -- David McCullough
> 
> Writing is arguably the critical ingredient to how we think and learn.  If you canâ€™t write about something coherently and intelligibly, then your thinking on that topic or subject is vague and incomplete.
> 
> Similarly, I'd argue writing is a key aspect to personal and professional organization too. Often through lists, note-taking, project management tools, or a process journal, we write out our plans, goals, intentions and other aspects that clarify what we want to accomplish.  Writing allows us to express vague feelings and turn them into intentions and goals.

## Inspiration

>  Hello. On this homepage, I publish some of my notes.

> Notes of what?
> 
> What not? They can include:
> study notes, taken while I learn;
> guides / tips;
> cheatsheets;
> observations;
> movie lists and other attempts to systematize;
> open questions / confusions.
>
> Most of all, it's not a blog.  Blogs (and social media) tend to peg each post to a point in time, so that they age like milk and not like wine.  That's the "stream" in [The Garden and the Stream](https://edstrom.dev/nbgks/the-garden-and-the-stream).  I always saw more sense in the "garden" a.k.a. evergreen/[long content](https://gwern.net/about#long-content), where you continually reuse, refine and exitend your pages.

> If there's any guiding principle, it's the notion of a slipbox as described by [Book: How to Take Smart Notes](https://edstrom.dev/tdzkq/book-how-to-take-smart-notes), though as of [2023-11-23 Thu] I think future-me wouldn't call this a good slipbox just yet.

> It may make sense to realize the notes existed **before** the website, they're **not written for it**.  I was writing them anyway, for my own purposes.

> There are lots of time-tracking programs out there that allow you to collect statistics about how you spend your time, which activities are your biggest time-wasters, and so on.

> * You need to stop what you're doing to insert the meta-information, and that breaks your concentration;
> * If you are lazy or get annoyed and don't keep updating it, the statistics will be useless
> * You won't be able to catch a little thing like quickly answering an e-mail or looking for the weather report.

> * Does it replace reading books? 
> * Do you typically read no more than one or two pages of a Web page before you "bounce" out to another page/site?
> * Do you save some articles which impressed you, and never ever re-read saved material? 
> * Are you browsing the Web during lunch breaks, or meals in general?

[1] From [Plain Text - brajeshwar.com](https://brajeshwar.com/2022/plain-text/#fn:plaintext):
> Plain Text is a loose term for data that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects.  It may also include a limited number of "whitespace" characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters.  Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects.
