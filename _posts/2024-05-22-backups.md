> BackupPC is written in Perl and extracts backup data via SMB using Samba, tar over ssh/rsh/nfs, or rsync.
> It is robust, reliable, well documented and freely available as Open Source on Github.

* [rsbackup_p2p -- Back up files on local machine to a peer server using rsync protocol](https://unixservertech.com/scripts/rsbackup_p2p.html)
> VERY insecure server replication tool.
> This requires root ssh access to the remote server via non-password protected ssh key.
> Suitable for replicating servers internally on a LAN or over a VPN connection, but not recommended for other installations.
> 
> Basically, uses rsync to update a path/ to remote server:path/.
> Allows for local scripting on source machine and target machine, both before and after synchronization occurs.

* [rsbackup_lib - Library used by all rsBackup scripts](https://unixservertech.com/scripts/rsbackup_lib.html) 
>  This is basically a single library that has common routines used by rsbackup_client, rsbackup_p2p and rsbackup_server.
>
> If you install any of these packages, this needs to be installed first. 

* [scripts - Needed scripts for rsbackup and rsbackup_p2p](https://unixservertech.com/scripts/scripts.html)
> Contains example conf file, and some initialization and cleanup scripts
>
> Additionally, it includes a copy of the open source sendEmail.pl script that allows sending of e-mail, with attachments, without the requirment of having a mail server installed on your machine.

> LVM snapshots are just another alternative to provide snapshot capabilities to filesystems.

> The main differences are that unionfs snapshots work at a higher level (directories), are filesystem agnostic and generally simpler to implement.

* [Immaculate Backup - Alex Papadimoulis - 2007-02-21](https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Immaculate_Backup_)

* [bu: A fast backup utility for Linux command-line systems. Backs up a file or directory and names it by date. Use it before editing critical files.](https://github.com/Tolaris/bu) - Shell script in Python

### Tools

**[TODO] - To change the title?**

* [prunef -  A backup rotation filter for your shell](https://sr.ht/~apreiml/prunef/)
> Takes an unsorted list of backup names and returns a list of backups for deletion.
> The backup rotation rules are given via command line args.
> The backup names need to contain the time and a date(1) like format specifier is required to parse those.

* [Rotate backups script](https://github.com/adamfeuer/rotate-backups)
> This script is designed to be used by processes that create tarred and compressed backups every hour or every day.
> These backups accumulate, taking up disk space.
> 
> By running this rotator script once per hour shortly before your hourly backup cron runs, you can save 24 houly backups, 7 daily backups and an arbitrary number of weekly backups (the default is 52).
