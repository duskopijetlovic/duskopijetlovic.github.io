##=== Re: mutt, PuTTY, and ISO-8859-1, oh my!
##    http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-users/msg05548.html
# PROBLEM
# Characters from the Latin1 character set are not displayed
# correctly.  This could be because your Mutt is not
# configured to show them, or (as in my case), because the
# header on this particular message listed a charset of
# 'us-ascii' even though the email actually used ISO-8859-1
# characters.
# SOLUTION
# Summary:  Tell Mutt that 'us-ascii' is just an alias for
# 'iso-8859-1'.
# 
# In my .muttrc:
#  These four lines tell Mutt to use Latin1 (ISO-8859-1) as
#  its standard charset.
#set charset="ISO-8859-1"
#set send_charset="ISO-8859-1:us-ascii"
#set use_8bitmime
#set allow_8bit

set rfc2047_parameters = yes

# Unicode Support on FreeBSD

# The former variant of send_charset tells mutt to tag outgoing mail as either 
# US-ASCII if the content of the message can be represented in US-ASCII, or UTF-8 
# if the content cannot be represented in US-ASCII. This behavior is consistent with other mailers. 
# However, some mailers apparently limit the encoding of replies to the charset of the received 
# message, which makes a message containing UTF-8 characters not possible from such mailers 
# as a reply to a message containing only US-ASCII. The second variant of send_charset, above, 
# tags all your outgoing messages as UTF-8, which avoids this problem, but which may cause 
# problems if you send an ASCII message to someone with a mailer which does not support UFT-8.
set send_charset="US-ASCII:UTF-8"
#set send_charset="UTF-8"

set use_envelope_from="yes"

# If your incoming mail is not displayed properly, check that you have the LANG environment 
# variable properly set (as described above) or configure mutt:
#set charset="UTF-8"
#set charset="en_CA.UTF-8"

# https://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/mutt-8859.html
# Instead of the author's 
#     charset-hook iso-8859-1 cp1252
# the fix for incorrectly displayed special characters 
# (for example: em dash, right single quotation mark) tell mutt when it sees 
# iso-8859-1, to use UTF-8 instead: 
# 
# How did I find out which character set to replace iso-8859-1 with?
#   A: I copied the text of the original message, pasted it in 
#      TEA text editor (http://semiletov.org/tea), (https://github.com/psemiletov/tea-qt) 
#      saved it, and reloaded it a few times (In TEA: File > File actions > Reload with encoding). 
#      - With encoding set to ISO-8859-1, TEA displayed the bad characters 
#        the same as Mozilla Firefox was showing them, that is: 
#          â€”  -- Latin small letter A with circumflex, Euro symbol, quotation mark 
#          €™   -- Euro symbol, Trade Mark sign 
#      - With encoding set to UTF-8, TEA displayed the characters correctly. 
# Also, 
# Ran the hexdump on the file:  
#     hexdump -b fileToConvert.txt
# And the outpuut was:
#     0000000 342 200 224 040 342 200 231
#     0000007
# From the man page for hexdump(1), for the -b option:
#     -b     One-byte octal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
#            followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, zero-filled,
#            bytes of input data, in octal, per line.
# 
# Decoded the values by using the following table:
# "Dynamic charset converter — interactive conversion tables to compare 8-bits character sets 
# viewing their unicode names and binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal and UTF-8 values"
#     http://www.acc.umu.se/~saasha/charsets/?charset=iso_8859-1&charset=cp1252
# Under "byte rendering" column, selected Input drop-down to be iso_8859-1,
# and the output to cp1252. 
# The sequence 
#    342 200 224 
# was in the "oct" sub-column of "UTF-8 encoding of each cp1252 character" column
# indicating that character and its formal unicode name is "em dash".
# Similarly, the sequence 
#     342 200 231 
# was in the "oct" sub-column of "UTF-8 encoding of each cp1252 character" column
# indicating that character and its formal unicode name is "right single quotation mark". 
# 
# These two sequences were exactly the same as Mutt was displaying them befor the fix,
# that is:
# > I got your message from Mike â\200\224 It doesnâ\200\231t happen to me, although I log
# > off when Iâ\200\231m done with my session.

# You want all of your plain text messages to be in this format. Otherwise, 
# they will look ugly and barely readable when your recipients open them on 
# their email clients.
## Disabled it on Jun 6, 2017.
## REASONS:
## 1) With the editor set to the traditional vi, if a composed message's line
## before the last line is shorter than 78 characters, e.g., the last line
## is the sender's name (signature), Mutt fills up the penultimate line
## with characters from the last line. 
## 2) Explanation from
##       http://www.firstpr.com.au/web-mail/Mozilla-mail/
## Format=Flowed (RFC 2646) is a pesky (more like infuriating and stupid, 
## I think - unless the sender makes an intelligent, informed and explicit 
## choice to use it) way of sending an otherwise plain text email.  
## The outgoing email is different from what is written and with 
## "Format=flowed" in the header, the receiving client is supposed to 
## rewrap the text to whatever margins there are in the current display window.
## The trouble is that this screws up the formatting of messages which have 
## been deliberately manually formatted for good reason.

# Enable use of the Alt key (or Escape key)
#
# The command is double-quoted and ends with the word Enter in brackets.
# In this case, using \n for a newline doesn't work. Also note that 
# I typed an exclamation point within the double quotes. The important 
# thing here is that I am duplicating what I would type while mutt is open.
# I usually try to get away with \n and if that doesn't work, then try 
# again with Enter in brackets. 
# 
# If you do this, then using a keyboard macro beginning with \e will work 
# with either the escape or the alt key. It's usually turned off by default.
# As usual, you can check your system-wide Muttrc. If you leave that set 
# meta_key option at its default of no, then using \e will work with the 
# escape key, but not the Alt key.
#
# Some googling indicated that this was because ctl+s stops sending data 
# to the terminal. Most Unix and Unix-like terminals still support this. 
# So, if a macro doesn't work, sometimes trying a different keyboard 
# combination might help--at least it should let you know if the problem 
# is your syntax or your chosen combination.

# - For example, to add an alias for an email address with 'dusko' in it:
# Shell command: /mnt/usbflashdrive/mydotfiles/mutt-common-files/muttalias.sh dusko
# - After that, mutt will prompt you to press any key to return from
